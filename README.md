# Netflix Clone Project

Welcome to my Netflix Clone project repository! In this project, I built a clone of the popular streaming platform Netflix. This project helped me learn about fundamental concepts in React, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and making API requests using `axios`.


## Technologies Used

- React
- HTML
- SASS
- Axios


## Key Features

- Displaying a list of movies and TV shows similar to Netflix's interface.
- Implementing responsive design for a seamless experience on various devices.
- Utilizing React's `useState` hook to manage state within functional components.
- Using `useEffect` to handle side effects and API calls when components mount.
- Fetching data from a third-party API using Axios.


## Lessons Learned

During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following concepts:

- Utilizing React hooks like `useState` for managing component state.
- Employing the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects and data fetching.
- Making asynchronous API requests using Axios and handling the returned data.


Happy coding!
